const score = 400   //js auto detect its number

const balance  = new Number(100)   //here we detected we have only number datatype
console.log(balance);  

console.log(balance.toString());  //its change type of number to string
console.log(balance.toString().length);  //we also check the length
console.log(balance.toFixed(2));  //its use for fixing the value after point(100.0000) means here only two zero so output is 100.00
